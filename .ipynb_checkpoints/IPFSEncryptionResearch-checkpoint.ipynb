    "# Overview\n",
    "This note explains a practical, secure pattern for storing and sharing healthcare records on IPFS using encryption, then gives a complete Python implementation you can adapt. It covers threat model, recommended cryptography (hybrid encryption with AES + RSA/ECC key-encryption), key management, privacy/regulatory points, and performance considerations. The design assumes you control an IPFS node or trusted gateway and will store only encrypted patient data on IPFS while keeping access control metadata (who can decrypt) off-chain or on a permissioned ledger.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key idea (hybrid encryption pattern)\n",
    "    - Generate a random symmetric key (AES-256-GCM) per file for confidentiality.\n",
    "    - Encrypt the medical file with that symmetric key (authenticated encryption to protect integrity).\n",
    "    - Encrypt the symmetric key for each authorized recipient using that recipient’s public key (RSA-OAEP or ECIES) so only intended recipients can recover the file key.\n",
    "    - Upload the ciphertext to IPFS; IPFS returns a CID that identifies the encrypted blob.\n",
    "    - Store the CID plus encrypted symmetric key(s) and minimal access metadata in your access-control store (permissioned blockchain, database, or access service). Use provenance/integrity audit (blockchain) only for metadata, not the encrypted data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Security benefits: decentralised storage and content addressing (integrity via CID), combined with strong cryptography for confidentiality; small metadata footprint on-chain preserves privacy while allowing auditable access logs."

    "### Notes:\n",
    "    - This example uses RSA-OAEP for simplicity. For scalable recipient sets, use an EC-based KEM (X25519) + HKDF to derive per-recipient keys (faster and smaller keys).  \n",
    "    - Store package metadata in a secure access control service, not in public IPFS data. Keep audit logs for access.  \n",
    "    - Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) to detect tampering.\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key management and best practices\n",
    "    - Use HSMs / cloud KMS for production private keys. Do not store private keys on shared application servers.  \n",
    "    - Rotate keys periodically and implement re-encryption workflows for revocation. For efficient re-encryption consider proxy re-encryption schemes (advanced, but promising for revocation without reuploading whole files).  \n",
    "    - Protect metadata: even encrypted CIDs can leak access patterns; consider mixing, access obfuscation, or a permissioned IPFS network for sensitive deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operational & performance considerations\n",
    "    - IPFS pinning: ensure nodes pin encrypted blobs to keep them available; otherwise garbage collection can remove them. Manage pinning policies and costs.  \n",
    "    - Chunking/large files: IPFS handles chunking, but encrypt entire file as single blob (per-file key) to maintain confidentiality. For streaming, use chunk-level keys or envelope encryption consistent with your access policy.  \n",
    "    - Bandwidth and latency: uploading/downloading large medical images over IPFS can be slower than dedicated cloud blobs. Consider hybrid architecture (on-prem node + IPFS for cross-org sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced topics (paths to strengthen system)\n",
    "    - Use ECC (X25519) for recipient key encap, with HKDF to derive AES keys—more efficient and modern than RSA for multiple recipients.  \n",
    "    - Consider attribute-based encryption (ABE) for policy-based sharing (complex and heavy).  \n",
    "    - Explore proxy re-encryption to support revocation without re-encrypting large files.  \n",
    "    - Use threshold encryption or multi-party HSM for shared custody of decryption rights.\n",
